warning @ixo/impactxclient-sdk > @cosmjs/crypto@0.32.4: This uses elliptic for cryptographic operations, which contains several security-relevant bugs. To what degree this affects your application is something you need to carefully investigate. See https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/issues/1708 for further pointers. Starting with version 0.34.0 the cryptographic library has been replaced. However, private keys might still be at risk.
