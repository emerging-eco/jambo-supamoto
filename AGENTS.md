# Agent Communication Preferences

## Response Format

When troubleshooting or analyzing issues, provide ONLY:

1. **Root cause analysis** (brief, 2-3 sentences max)
2. **The fix** (actual code changes needed)
3. **How to verify** (steps to confirm it works)

Do NOT include:

- Summary documents or recap sections
- Checklists or verification checklists
- Multiple versions of the same information
- Extra documentation artifacts unless explicitly requested

## When Unclear

- Ask for clarification rather than assume
- Keep questions concise and direct

## General Principle

Prioritize conciseness and actionability over comprehensiveness. Assume the user prefers efficiency over exhaustive documentation.
